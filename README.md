Ever wish you could quickly test an API endpoint? I can't tell you how many times I've found an API I want to build my project around, and it doesn't work. It's frustrating spending x amount of time getting the initial environment, code and fetch call fired up, only to test the endpoint and it doesn't work as promised. Enter API URL Tester. Enter an API endpoint to quickly test a GET request. If the request is good, it will render the expected JSON.

Built with React.js, incorporating the react-json-pretty extension, https://lnkd.in/d7-j23K.

Try out API URL Tester with https://lnkd.in/dAKdy2T an API that renders a random joke in JSON.

Still to do: render different error messages based on the scenario. Change the styling that comes with the react-json-pretty extension. And make the site fully responsive.
